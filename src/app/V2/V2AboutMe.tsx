        I'm a software engineer with a knack for solving problems with software.
        I have experience working with Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, and more.
        I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a
        developer.

        My journey has been all over the place, from finance, to dentistry, but
        ultimately I found my passion in software engineering. Being a former
        athlete, I have a 'grind' mindeset and love feedback because that is
        where growth happens. No matter the problem, I will always find a way.
