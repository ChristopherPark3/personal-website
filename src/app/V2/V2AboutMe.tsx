        I'm a software engineer with a knack for solving problems with software.
        I have experience working with Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, and more.
        I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a
        developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey has been all over the place, from finance, to dentistry, but
        ultimately I found my passion in software engineering. I'm a firm
        believer that it's never too late to start something new, and I'm
        very excited to see where this journey takes me.
